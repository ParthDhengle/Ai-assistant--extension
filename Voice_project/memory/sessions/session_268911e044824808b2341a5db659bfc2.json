I have been developed using Python and trained with machine learning algorithms to understand and respond to your queries. My main functions include listening to user inputs, processing them, and responding accordingly.\n\nAs for my physical presence, I don't have a body or sensors like a real-life assistant. Instead, I am embedded within the project files you see on the current working directory: C:\\Users\\Parth Dhengle\\Desktop\\Projects\\Gen Ai\\Ai-extension\\Voice_project. The key components of my code can be found in the 'core', 'memory', 'models', and 'utils' folders, with the main script being 'valentrom_script.py'.\n\nI am still a work in progress and will continue to learn and improve over time!",
